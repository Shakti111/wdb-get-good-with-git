I made my first web page on Notebook back in '92 just when the first graphical browser came out, NCSA Mosaic.  I was in grad school (for Slavic Linguistics) and was working as a lab consultant handing student and faculty computer issues (lots of thesis papers that had been accidentally erased on the only disketted they had been saved to, etc.).

I got my first job in computers as a tech support guy for an Emergency Management software company in 1995, and convinced them to create their first website, which I helped develop.  It was very primative, here's a [link to it from the Wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/web/19961103203949/http://www.eisintl.com/)

After that, I mainly worked for government contractors where I worked initially in Cold Fusion, then Classic ASP, then ASP.Net Webforms (in C#).

I live with my wife and daughter and rescue dog Lali in Reston, VA
