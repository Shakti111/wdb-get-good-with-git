Welcome to our new repo, where **we all** learn to get good with `git` 😁.

As you all know, using `git` in a work environment is crucial for a Web Developers workflow. It is even more important when working with others.

**I DO NOT** claim to know everything there is to know about `git`, as I have only ever used it in my own [personal projects](https://github.com/jjaimealeman).

The purpose of this repo is for us/we/me/you to learn the basics of using `git`, both for personal use as well as in a team environment.

> ## This is my first ever collaborative repo working with others. So forgive me as I learn how to manage the collaborative tools that Github has to offer.

More content will be added as we progress with our new project 👍.
