## Welcome to our new repo, where **we all** learn to get good with `git` 😁

---

I created this repo with the help of friends Aaron Watts and Shakti.

We are all students of the [Web Developers Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele on Udemy and members of their [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialwebdeveloperbootcamp).

## What is this about? What is the objective?

As you all know, using `git` in your environment is crucial for a Web Developers workflow. It is even more important when working with others.

Throughout my time on the FB group, I realized that not many members were familiar with `git` and wanted to learn.

So, one day I [created a poll](https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialwebdeveloperbootcamp/posts/4656639691068240) and was thrilled at the outcome.

### What is git?

> ![git.png](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/git.png) `git` is a version control system.
>
> It tracks all changes made to files under its directory and allows developers to quickly revert back to any version of any file. Also makes project collaboration easier by multiple authors and makes it easy to merge all changes into one source.

### What is Github?

> ![github.png](https://img.icons8.com/windows/32/000000/github.png) [Github](https://github.com/) is a cloud-hosted website for storing files under version control using `git`.
>
> It is used for code sharing, debugging, and collaboration. It is also a Social Networking site used by Developers and Programmers all around the world!

### Why is git important and how can git help me?

## **I DO NOT** claim to know everything there is to know about `git`, as I have only ever used it in my own [personal projects](https://github.com/jjaimealeman).

The purpose of this repo is for **us/we/me/you** to learn the basics of using `git`, both for personal use as well as in a team environment.

---

> ## This is my first ever collaborative repo working with others. So forgive me as I learn how to manage the collaborative tools that Github has to offer.

## First Steps:

1. Watch this repo.
2. Fork this repo.
3. Clone your repo.

If you are an absolute beginner and know nothing about `git`, then I encourage you to check out [these GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git).

## Commands to get your started

These **9 commands** are absolutely the BASIC ones you will most likely use for this project repo.

> `git init` ; `git clone` ; `git add` ; `git commit` ; `git status` ; `git branch` ; `git merge` ; `git pull` ; `git push`

I have used these for years and type them a hundred times per day.
