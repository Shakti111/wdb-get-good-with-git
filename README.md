## Welcome to our new repo, where **we all** learn to get good with `git` 😁

I created this repo with the help of friends Aaron Watts and Shakti Sarkar.

We are all students of the [Web Developers Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele on Udemy and members of their [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialwebdeveloperbootcamp).

## What is this about? What is the objective?

Using `git` in your environment is crucial for a Web Developers workflow. It is even more important when working with others.

Throughout my time on the [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialwebdeveloperbootcamp), I realized that not many members were familiar with `git`.

So, one day I [created a poll](https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialwebdeveloperbootcamp/posts/4656639691068240) and was thrilled at the outcome.

### What is git?

> ![git.png](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/git.png) `git` is a version control system.
>
> It tracks all changes made to files under its directory and allows developers to quickly revert back to any version of any file. Also makes project collaboration easier by multiple authors and makes it easy to merge all changes into one source.

### What is Github?

> ![github.png](https://img.icons8.com/windows/32/000000/github.png) [Github](https://github.com/) is a cloud-hosted website for storing files under version control using `git`.
>
> It is used for code sharing, debugging, and collaboration. It is also a Social Networking site used by Developers and Programmers all around the world!

### Why is git important and how can git help me?

## **I DO NOT** claim to know everything there is to know about `git`, as I have only ever used it in my own [personal projects](https://github.com/jjaimealeman).

The purpose of this repo is for **us/we/me/you** to learn the basics of using `git`, both for personal use as well as in a team environment.

---

> ## This is my first ever collaborative repo working with others. So forgive me as I learn how to manage the collaborative tools that Github has to offer.

## First Steps:

1. Watch this repo.
2. Fork this repo.
3. Clone your repo.

If you are an absolute beginner and know nothing about `git`, then I encourage you to check out [these GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git).

## Commands to get your started

These **9 commands** are absolutely the BASIC ones you will most likely use for this project repo.

> `git init`
>
> Initializes `git` and begins the process for adding your files to version control.

> `git clone`
>
> Makes an exact duplicate on your computer - complete with all history of file revisions.

> `git add`
>
> Tells `git` that a file has been modified and has now been added to version control.

> `git commit`
>
> Inserts a comment in the histroy of a file _(or multiple files)_ stating what was modified, added, or delete.

> `git status`
>
> Displays what has been recently modified, added, or deleted.

> `git branch`
>
> Displays the current working branch _(by default called `main` or `master`)_.
>
> It is a common practice to have more than one branch where other work is being done without "breaking" the original environment in `main`.

> `git merge`
>
> Another branch can be created to make many edits to many files in a safe environment without altering the original files in in `main` and later `merge` them together.
>
> This is commonly done when adding new Features to `main` or Bug-Fixing.

> `git pull`
>
> When files are modified to the online reposity, they can be synced with the local repository.

> `git push`
>
> When files are modified to the local repository, they can be synced with the online repository.

I have used these for years and type them a hundred times per day.
