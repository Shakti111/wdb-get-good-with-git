## Welcome to our new repo, where **we all** learn to get good with `git` 😁

As you all know, using `git` in a work environment is crucial for a Web Developers workflow. It is even more important when working with others.

I created this repo with the help of friends Aaron Watts and Shakti

> ![git.png](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/git.png) `git` is a version control system. It tracks all changes made to files under its directory.

> ![github.png](https://img.icons8.com/windows/32/000000/github.png) [Github](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based repository for storing files.

## **I DO NOT** claim to know everything there is to know about `git`, as I have only ever used it in my own [personal projects](https://github.com/jjaimealeman).

The purpose of this repo is for **us/we/me/you** to learn the basics of using `git`, both for personal use as well as in a team environment.

> ## This is my first ever collaborative repo working with others. So forgive me as I learn how to manage the collaborative tools that Github has to offer.

## First Steps:

1. Watch this repo.
2. Fork this repo.
3. Clone your repo.

If you are an absolute beginner and know nothing about `git`, then I encourage you to check out [these GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git).

## Commands to get your started

These **9 commands** are absolutely the BASIC ones you will most likely use for this project repo.

> `git init` ; `git clone` ; `git add` ; `git commit` ; `git status` ; `git branch` ; `git merge` ; `git pull` ; `git push`

I have used these for years and type them a hundred times per day.
